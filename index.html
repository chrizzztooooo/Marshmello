            Marshmello is the pseudonym of an American dance music producer and DJ whose real identity is a subject of speculation. He wears a bucket shaped Marshmallow helmet on his head to hide his face. He first burst into the electronic music scene in 2015. In 2017, sufficient indications appeared on social media that identify him as American DJ Chris Comstock but officially, Marshmello has neither confirmed nor denied that he his Comstock. In November 2017, Forbes magazine published an article in which they claimed Chris Comstock to be Marshmello based on an old interview with another DJ, royalty earnings records and the common manager for Marshmello and Chris Comstock but there was no official confirmation of the same from the management and the lawyer of Marshmello. Despite speculation about his identity, Marshmello remains one of the most popular as well as acclaimed DJs in the world today. According to some, his anonymous identity adds an element of mystery to his persona that helps him gain popularity. He has been prolific and has built an extensive body of work in a short period of time.
